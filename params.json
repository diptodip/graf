  "body": "# GRAF\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is **``graf``**, software for counting cells in FISH microscopy images. **``graf``** uses image processing techniques such as Canny edge detection and watershed thresholding along with connected component analysis to identify/count these cells. This avoids the problem of having to train a learning algorithm, which can waste lab time and also be clunky to use.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCurrently, **``graf``** is in early development stages and does not have a GUI. That means **``graf``** must be used from the terminal and also requires a functional installation of OpenCV (in addition to a scientific install of Python). The single script that must be called right now is ``graf.py``. The usage is shown below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\n    python graf.py (-i | --image <path/to/image>)\r\n```\r\nFor now, there is only the ``-i | --image`` option (which is required) that takes the image path argument. This is used to specify the image to analyze. Image stacks are not supported because **``graf``** is in such early stages of development. This feature will come in a future update. An example of what **``graf``** currently does is shown below.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Terminal with graf command](img/terminal.png)\r\n![Original image](img/original.png)\r\n![Edge detection](img/edges.png)\r\n![Highlighted image](img/highlight.png)\r\nThe above images show the output in both the terminal (which shows the counted number of cells) as well as the OpenCV image visualizations that depict the cells detected by **``graf``** and highlight their positions on the image. This example image of *C. elegans* embryos was taken from [Rifkin Labs](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/rifkin/software.html) and all rights to the image belong to them as specified.\r\n",
